Awful communication, split delivery and missing boxes.  Manifest description did not match items delivered so we have no easy way to know what\u2019s disappeared.  The NZ packers were barely literate and for all we know helped themselves to small items -  Grace can\u2019t prove they didn\u2019t because they have no detailed item list.   This company has the contract with WA Education for removals but clearly doesn\u2019t value the role they play in facilitating teachers and their families to move seamlessly to hard to staff regional areas.  The insurance promises are worthless if there is no reliable item list, and once the moving process with Grace is started there appears to be little sincere chance of timely recovery or replacement of missing or damaged goods.  I will never use you again and will vocally tell others not to relocate with Grace.  A generic \u201cwe\u2019re sorry\u201d electronic reply to this post will not satisfy me or my family that your company truly cares. Plenty of those company responses on line\u2026.  Don\u2019t offer a service if you can\u2019t deliver robustly.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"1.0","bestRating":5,"worstRating":1},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andy R."}},{"@type":"Review","datePublished":"2023-02-23","reviewBody":"Really good service.
